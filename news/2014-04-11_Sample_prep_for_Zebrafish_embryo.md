Michael Weber from Jan Huisken lab has put together a nice protocol page describing [preparation of zebrafish embryos for multi-view SPIM imaging](../Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation). Lots of photographs!

For more information see the JoVE video of the protocol

  - [Multilayer Mounting for Long-term Light Sheet Microscopy of Zebrafish](https://www.jove.com/video/51119/multilayer-mounting-for-long-term-light-sheet-microscopy-of-zebrafish)

and the paper in Development

  - [Multilayer mounting enables long-term imaging of zebrafish development in a light sheet microscope](https://dev.biologists.org/content/139/17/3242.abstract)
