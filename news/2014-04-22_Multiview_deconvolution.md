**Stephan Preibisch's** multiview deconvolution algorithm and the associated [**Fiji plugin**](https://fiji.sc/Multi-View_Deconvolution) was published at [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.2929.html). The approach is relevant as a fusion strategy for OpenSPIM data, which it improves dramatically due to relative thickness of the lightsheet.

Stephan Preibisch, Fernando Amat, Evangelia Stamataki, Mihail Sarov, Robert H Singer, Eugene Myers & Pavel Tomancak (2014) **Efficient Bayesian-based multiview deconvolution** *Nature Methods* AOP <doi:10.1038/nmeth.2929> [**PDF**](document/Nmeth.2929.pdf), [**Supplement**](document/Nmeth.2929-S1.pdf)

Check out the extensive supplement that provides the derivation of the algorithm (for the mathematically inclined) and extensive evaluation and benchmarking against other approaches. The GPU code was developed by **Fernando Amat** from Philipp Keller's lab at the Janelia Farm.

The paper comes with an extensive collection of **Supplementary Videos** available at [**Nature Methods website**](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/nmeth.2929_SV1.html).
