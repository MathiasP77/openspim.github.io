We provide new instructions and guides on how to assemble, configure, and align an X-OpenSPIM, together with a completely overhauled software plugin [Î¼OpenSPIM](https://openspim.org/micro-openspim). This makes it easier and less time-consuming for OpenSPIM users to upgrade to a more advanced OpenSPIM system and use it as a powerful research tool in their laboratories.

For more details see also our publication [on Advanced Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adbi.202101182).
