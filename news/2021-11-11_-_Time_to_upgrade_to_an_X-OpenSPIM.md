##	Welcome to the X-OpenSPIM site on openspim.org!
Here we provide new instructions and guides on how to [assemble, configure](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adbi.202101182), and [align](https://openspim.org/xopenspim/alignment_welcome) an [X-OpenSPIM](https://openspim.org/table_of_parts_xopenspim), together with a completely overhauled software plugin [μOpenSPIM](https://openspim.org/micro-openspim). This makes it easier and less time-consuming for OpenSPIM users to upgrade to a more advanced OpenSPIM system and use it as a powerful research tool in their laboratories.
